    <li><a href="https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/"> ESPN Fantasy Football</a></li>
    <p>I think this fantasy football website that ESPN has put together is well put together and has a well organized user interface. Looking at the code of the website it does look like it's more modern and up to date. I have also been playing fantasy football for a long time through ESPN and they always do a good job of keeping their format up to date and modernizing their website to appeal to their users. I think another aspect is that there seems to be a really good balance between information both to click on and to read, and organized tabs that you can look into. The other thing ESPN does well here is they start with much more generic information that is for all fantasy football players and then they have a tab that gives you a more customized experience which can be looked into by clicking on tabs that go into your specific league or team and can give you more information that pertains to you and your experience. Color wise, I think the website does a good job staying basic and staying with a consistent theme throughout the website so that there isn't much of a distraction and it doesn't take away from the images that ESPN uses to lure users into their articles and information they are trying to portray to their following. Also, the scoreboard listed at the top of the page indicates a knowledge of the demographic that ESPN is looking at tailoring their experience to and doesn't distract from the website, but at the same, it gives some extra information if one is interested and if that appeals to the user. The website is easily navigable with the options on how to go deeper into the website and get the information you want pretty clear and accessible. Overall I think this website achieves the experience it wants and gives us a good idea on how to make something both functional, and visually appealing.   </p>
    <li><a href="https://tfrrs.org/"> tfrrs Track and XC Results</a></li>
    <p>tfrrs in my opinion is another example of a good website. It has good functionality and easy formatting to follow, making the experience for the user pretty efficient. Also, when you look up results it has links to each team and each athlete shown in the results which makes it so much easier to navigate so you aren't constantly having to search around on the search bar for whatever team or athlete you want to now know information about. One downside to tfrrs is it's not the most appealing on the eyes and simply just has green or blue backgrounds. Also, the amount of information they present off the bat can maybe be a bit overwhelming, but in the end for what it is, they do a good job of spacing it out so you have to keep clicking to the next page to see what you want or if you want a ranking of the top 100 people in an event, they have that but only if you choose to. In the tabs at the top of the page there are also search commands that help you find the different teams and athletes you are looking for by giving suggestions and recommendations when you have partially typed a potential result into the interface. This website also compiles times and results from all sorts of timing services and organizes it into one source, which is extremely valuable and helps coaches and athletes everywhere with results that they want to see and helps there be a central database for this information. Tfrrs looks to use HTML5 code as well as some google analytics attributes, which can be very helpful in analyzing their user database and which features are hitting home in the way they want them to. The layout is done really well because it's a lot of information to organize onto one screen and they've done it to where scrolling is easy and sensible, however I have used the mobile part of this on my phone and with the smaller screen, sometimes you have to scroll side to side a bit.</p>
    <li><a href="https://www.subway.com/en-us">Subway</a></li>
    <p>Subway has a very distracting and dysfunctional website in my opinion. First of all, with the home page, there is a huge add that pops up for one of their own sandwiches before I even hit the page, and then once I do there are advertisements for more sandwiches. The order button seems almost hidden in the top left of the page, which seems like it should be front and center and easy to access, given that that's what most customers are probably looking for off the bat already. The promotions as I go down the page are endless and not organized very well in my opinion. The advertisements and coupons vary drastically in size which is confusing and feels like it funnels me to aspects of the website that should not be the focus. Once clicking on the order section there is a huge map of the united states to choose location from, as opposed to a simple address bar or a state dropdown or something along those lines that I have seen in many other restaurants' websites. The color scheme in certain segragated areas is good, but then it completely changes to a darker tone and makes things confusing for the user. The website does look modern as well as the code, which is a plus, but the images are overwhelming and are too intrusive to really let you think clearly and accomplish what you went on the site to do in the first place. The page goes way too far down in my opinion. A home page should not be this much information in my opinion, just serve as a funnel for where the user wants to pay their attention.  </p>
