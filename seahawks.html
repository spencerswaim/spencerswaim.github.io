      <p>The Seattle Seahawks come into the 2021 season with high aspirations to return to the Super Bowl. With a new offensive coordinator and newly focused roster to complement Russell Wislon, Seattle looks to be a tough out this year.</p>
      <p>Seattle got off to a great start to the season by beating the Colts 28-16, but unfortunately dropped their home opener in week 2 to Tennesse in overtime on a GW FG.</p>
      <p>Please do your best to make it out to Lumen Field this year to support your Seahawks on the road to the Super Bowl, and use the tickets tab to do so! If there is a game going on currently, you can stream it here:</p>
