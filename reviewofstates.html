<h1>Review Of States</h1>

<h2>My Rankings:</h2>

<h3>My Top Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a>

<p>I like the Alaska website because of its layout and the tab options it has on the top that seem general enough to get to most
  of the directories that people would typically need to go to on a state website. I think it's well organized and aesthetically pleasing
  and also has images that don't confuse, but contribute to the appeal of the website.

<h3>My Second Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas</a>

<p>I like the Arkansas website quite a bit because it has good color scheme and has images with many of it's tabs. There's also
  a home page that scrolls quite a ways and has big images with descriptions and options of people to contact or departments
  to look into. Also the big search bar at the start is helpful in trying to get people directed to the places they want without
  initially overloading you on information.

<h3>My Third Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">Maine</a>

<p>I think the Maine website is not terrible but I think there are a lot of thingsgoing on past the menu tab on the first page Maryland
  that can be both distracting and difficult to figure out where you would like to navigate to on the website. I also think there's a wide variety
  of graphics that are contributing to a bit of confusion for the user potentially.

<h3>My Fourth Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Maryland</a>

<p>The Maryland website is a little different and isn't super aesthetcially pleasing with not very many images and big tabs at the bottom
  of the initial page that seem redundant and a little bit unncessesarily attention grabbing. I also think there is too much put on the user to navigate
  the website which could be more time consuming for the user.

<h3>My Last Choice:</h3>

<a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/">Kansas</a>

<p>The Kansas page is reliant upon solely the search bar which can be again dififcult on the user. Also, there's just not a ton going on with it
  and can be difficult for the user to have direction wit where they're going or what they can really use the website for. The main
  messages seem to be about COVID and can be confusing to the user.
