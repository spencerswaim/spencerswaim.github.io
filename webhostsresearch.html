<h2>The Three Web Hosts:</h2>

<body>

<p>Visit <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/">hostinger.com</a></p>
<p> Hostinger has fast server, good reliability, and in case their reliability fails you, customer support that can help you get through the
  issues you're having. It's also priced well. It has a user-friendly website builder and an automatic website setup which helps that process go quickly.

<p>Visit <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">hostgator.com</a></p>
<p> Hostgator is a more beginner friendly host and has the free SSL and domain like Hostinger. It also has 24/7 customer service so they are available to
  help with your needs and have a good variety of plans that suite your needs.

<p>Visit <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/">bluehost.com</a></p>
<p> BlueHost has an easy setup and also has a variety of options for website builders and their specified needs. Like Hostgator and hostinger it has free SSL and domain and
  has insightful analytics and marketing tools that are going to optimize the user experience.

<h3>What would I choose?</h3>
<p> I would choose hostgator because it seems like it's pretty beginner friendly and has cheap rates that can help my website
  get off the ground. I am not super tech savvy so the easier the website is to figure out, the better for me and I also would not
  like to have to go through a long process of getting my website launched. The unlimited storage and fast loading speeds are also
  big plusses for me. </p>
